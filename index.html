Hi! This is my first personal public webpage...

## Images
<p>
Upload an image to the *assets* folder and embed it with `![title](/assets/name.jpg))`. Keep in mind that the path needs to be adjusted if Jekyll is run inside a subfolder.

A wrapper `div` with the class `large` can be used to increase the width of an image or iframe.

## Embedded content
<p>
You can also embed a lot of stuff, for example from YouTube, using the `embed.html` include.

## {% include embed.html url="https://denawk.github.com/denawk.github.io/IMG-7245.MOV" %}

<video controls="controls" width="800" height="600" name="Test Winnie the Pooh" src="https://denawk.github.com/denawk.github.io/assets/IMG-7246.MOV"></video>
</p>
